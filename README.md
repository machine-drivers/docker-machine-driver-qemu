# Docker machine qemu driver

I needed a non-libvirt qemu driver, so this is it.


from @SvenDowideit

Its initial use is going to be for running the [Rancher OS](https://github.com/rancher/os) tests, but maybe you'll find a use for it too.

#### QEMU

Create machines locally using [QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/).
This driver requires QEMU to be installed on your host.

    $ docker-machine create --driver=qemu qemu-test

Options:

 - `--qemu-boot2docker-url`: The URL of the boot2docker image. Defaults to the latest available version.
 - `--qemu-disk-size`: Size of disk for the host in MB. Default: `20000`
 - `--qemu-memory`: Size of memory for the host in MB. Default: `1024`
 - `--qemu-cpu-count`: Number of CPUs. Default: `1`
 - `--qemu-program` : Name of the qemu program to run. Default: `qemu-system-x86_64`
 - `--qemu-display` : Show the graphical display output to the user. Default: false
 - `--qemu-display-type` : Select type of display to use (sdl/vnc=localhost:0/etc)
 - `--qemu-nographic` : Use -nographic instead of -display none. Default: false
 - `--qemu-virtio-drives` : Use virtio for drives (cdrom and disk). Default: false
 - `--qemu-network`: Networking to be used: user, tap, vde or bridge. Default: `user`
 - `--qemu-network-interface`: Name of the network interface to be used for networking. Default: `tap0`
 - `--qemu-network-address`: IP of the network address to be used for networking.
 - `--qemu-network-socket`: Path of the network socket to be used for networking.
 - `--qemu-network-bridge`: Name of the network bridge to be used for networking. Default: `br0`

The `--qemu-boot2docker-url` flag takes a few different forms.  By
default, if no value is specified for this flag, Machine will check locally for
a boot2docker ISO.  If one is found, that will be used as the ISO for the
created machine.  If one is not found, the latest ISO release available on
[boot2docker/boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker) will be
downloaded and stored locally for future use.  Note that this means you must run
`docker-machine upgrade` deliberately on a machine if you wish to update the "cached"
boot2docker ISO.

This is the default behavior (when `--qemu-boot2docker-url=""`), but the
option also supports specifying ISOs by the `http://` and `file://` protocols.
`file://` will look at the path specified locally to locate the ISO: for
instance, you could specify `--qemu-boot2docker-url
file://$HOME/Downloads/rc.iso` to test out a release candidate ISO that you have
downloaded already.  You could also just get an ISO straight from the Internet
using the `http://` form.

Note that when using virtio the drives will be mounted as `/dev/vda` and `/dev/vdb`,
instead of the usual `/dev/cdrom` and `/dev/sda`, since they are using paravirtualization.

If using the real network (tap, vde or bridge), note that it needs a DHCP server running.
The user network has it's own NAT network, which usually means it is running on 10.0.2.15
Ultimately this driver should be able to query for IP, but for now the workaround is
to use `--qemu-network-address` (and fixed addresses) until that feature is implemented.

Environment variables:

Here comes the list of the supported variables with the corresponding options. If both environment
variable and CLI option are provided the CLI option takes the precedence.

| Environment variable              | CLI option                        |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `QEMU_BOOT2DOCKER_URL`            | `--qemu-boot2docker-url`          |
| `QEMU_VIRTIO_DRIVES`              | `--qemu-virtio-drives`            |
